# Disc golf stats

Disc golf stats is a score keeping service intended for a smallish group of people, with numerous statistics and features.

## Description

Disc golf stats keeps track of players' scores on different courses and presents them as score cards along with game information, including game conditions such as weather. Regular users can add new games, courses and competitions. They can also update or delete the ones they added themselves, whereas admin users can manage all of them.

The service provides numerous statistics for players and courses. It is possible to create a competition with multiple events.

Adding scores during a round is handy with a mobile user interface built with [Onsen UI](https://onsen.io), featuring live scoring.

Disc golf stats uses a PostgreSQL database implemented with PHP. Its features include page caching, interactive graphs, course weather, admin/regular users and creating/reading/updating/deleting data through user interfaces.
